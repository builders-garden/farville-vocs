## 🌾 Farming Strategy

Choose your crops wisely based on growth times and rewards:

- **Short Seeds (Wheat, Carrot):** 6h grow time ⏱️, low cost 💰, quick XP ⚡. Perfect for frequent visits!
- **Medium Seeds (Potato, Corn):** 12h cycles, moderate cost, balanced XP/coin returns 💎.
- **Long Seeds (Pumpkin, Watermelon):** 36–48h 🕰️, massive yields 🍉, ideal for larger farmland expansions 🌱.

This also depends on your playstyle:

- **Casual Farmer** 🌱 – Plant short crops for quick XP and coins. Use boosters to speed up growth.
- **Competitive Farmer** 🏁 – Focus on finishing quests and maximizing XP. Use long crops for high rewards and coins when you can’t do more quests.

### 🎁 Donations

You can donate to farmers who request help in **Farcaster**. For each item you donate, you'll gain **5 XPs**.

Donations have daily limits, which reset at 00:00 UTC. You can donate up to:

- **5 farmers** per day 🧑‍🌾
- **2 times** per farmer per day 🌽

These limits have been introduced to prevent farmers to climb the leaderboards by only donating.

## 📋 Daily & Weekly Quests

Every day, check your Quests log for fresh challenges:

- **Standard Quests:** Plant 🌾, harvest 🌽 or sell surplus.
- **Social Quests:** Donate or Receive seeds and crops 🎁.

And challenge yourself completing the Weekly quests which are more rewarding and difficult to achieve.

> 👉 **Tip:** Completing daily quests nets you extra XP and keeps you on track!

### 🧬 Quests Generation

Quests are generated **pseudo-randomly** each day and week, based on predefined types and completion amounts.

#### Structure

- Players receive:
  - 🗓️ **3 Daily Quests** every day
  - 📅 **3 Weekly Quests** every week
- Quests are tied to a **pool of possible crop tasks** (e.g., plant, harvest, boost).
- Amounts required vary within balanced ranges to fit casual and active playstyles.

#### League-Based Fairness

- Quests are **league-specific** 🏆
  - All players within the same league receive the **same quests**.
- This ensures:
  - A **fair playing field** 🟰
  - **Better competition** among peers ⚔️

#### XP Reward Balancing

- Quests with **low-XP crops** (🥕 carrots, 🌽 corns, 🥬 lettuces)  
  → reward **more XP**.
- Quests with **high-XP crops** (🎃 pumpkins, 🍉 watermelons)  
  → reward **less XP** per unit.

> 💡 This balancing encourages players to **diversify their crop usage**, rather than focusing only on the most profitable ones.
> This means that if you farm the whole week pumpkins, without considering quests, you'll earn way less XPs.

## 🏆 Ranking

Compete with other players in weekly **Leagues** to climb the ranks and win juicy rewards! 🍓
