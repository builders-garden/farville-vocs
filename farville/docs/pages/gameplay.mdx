Once you've set up your farm, here's how to advance your farm, cooperate with others, and make the most of Farville's alpha.

1. Daily Quests
Each day, you’ll find a list of quests in your quest log.

- Standard: Typically involve planting or harvesting specific crops, selling surplus items, or using boosters.
- Social: E.g., donating seeds, receiving items from friends, or fertilizing a friend’s farm.

Complete these quests daily to gain extra XP and a sense of structure.

2. Weekly & Monthly Challenges
Weekly: Larger tasks (e.g., “Harvest 150 Tomatoes”) that reset every 7 days.
Monthly: Overarching alpha challenge (like “Collect & Donate 500 crops”), awarding big XP and unique rewards.

3. Farming Strategy
Short Seeds (e.g., Wheat, Carrot): 6h grow time, low cost, quick XP. Great for frequent logins.
Medium Seeds (Potato, Corn): 12h cycles, moderate cost, balanced XP/COIN returns.
Long Seeds (Pumpkin, Watermelon): 36–48h, large yields, require bigger farmland expansions.

4. Death Time
If you don’t collect a crop by the end of its Death Time, that crop withers.

5. Trading & Donations
Trade: Swap crops or items with friends if both parties have surplus.
Donations: Give seeds to newcomers, or request rare items from advanced players. Quests often revolve around these interactions for extra XP.

6. Leveling & Expansions
Level Up by accumulating XP from activities.
Unlock farmland expansions (4×4 at Level 5, 5×5 at Level 10, 6×6 at Level 15) to grow more seeds at once.
